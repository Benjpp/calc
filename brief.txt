Take the following expresion as a example: 
	"34+13*2-6/3"
The result would calculated in this manner for example, "34+26-2", "60-2", "58"

Following a left to right type of building, we could construct the binary operation tree

	   -
	 /   \
	+     /
       / \   / \
      34  * 6   3
	 / \ 
	13  2
